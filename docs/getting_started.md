## Introduction to Solar Forecasting
Solar forecasting is the process of predicting the amount of solar energy that will be generated over a specific period. Understanding this helps optimize renewable energy systems and integrate them with the grid.

---

## Coding Style
To ensure code quality and maintain consistency, we follow the [Open Climate Fix (OCF) Coding Style](https://github.com/openclimatefix/.github/blob/main/coding_style.md). All contributors are expected to adhere to these standards.

### Key Points:
- **Formatting**: Use `black` with a line length of 100 characters.
- **Linting**: Run `ruff` to catch and fix style violations.
- **Docstrings**: Write Google-style docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Install pre-commit hooks to automatically format and lint your code before commits.

Refer to the full [OCF Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/openclimatefix/.github/blob/main/coding_style.md) for detailed instructions.

## What is NWP Data?
**Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)** data uses mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to forecast weather. It predicts various atmospheric conditions such as temperature, pressure, wind speed, humidity, precipitation type and amount, cloud cover, and sometimes even surface conditions and air quality—all of which are crucial for solar forecasting.

## Understanding Zarr Format

**zarr** is a relatively new, cloud-based data format designed to improve access to N-dimensional arrays. It provides an effective way to store large N-dimensional data in the cloud, with access facilitated through predefined chunks. Zarr can be viewed as the cloud-based counterpart to HDF5/NetCDF files, as it follows a similar data model. However, unlike NetCDF or HDF5, which store data in a single file, Zarr organizes data as a directory containing compressed binary files for chunks of data, alongside metadata stored in external JSON files.

The semantic mapping from the NetCDF Data Model to the Zarr Data Model is as follows:

| NetCDF Data Model | Zarr V2 Data Model                |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| File              | Store                             |
| Group             | Group                             |
| Variable          | Array                             |
| Attribute         | User Attribute                    |
| Dimension         | Not supported as a native feature |

A Zarr array can be stored in any storage system that supports a key/value interface. In this system:

A key is an ASCII string.
A value is an arbitrary sequence of bytes.
Supported operations include:
Read: Retrieve the sequence of bytes associated with a key.
Write: Set the sequence of bytes associated with a key.
Delete: Remove a key/value pair.
Currently, Zarr V2 is the stable version, while Zarr V3 is considered experimental.

- **Mean Bias Error (MBE)**: Measures the average bias in model predictions, indicating whether predictions are systematically overestimating or underestimating.
- **Precision**: In classification tasks, the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. Indicates the accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of true positives to the actual positives in the dataset. Measures the ability to capture all relevant instances.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric for evaluating model performance in classification.

#### **Optimization and Cost Functions**
- **Cost Function**: A function that measures the difference between the predicted and actual values, guiding the optimization process. Examples include:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Commonly used in regression tasks.
  - **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Frequently used in classification tasks.
- **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm used to minimize the cost function by iteratively adjusting the model parameters in the direction of the steepest descent.
  - **Learning Rate**: A hyperparameter that determines the step size during gradient descent. A smaller rate ensures convergence but may slow down training.
- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: A variation of gradient descent where a single data point or a small batch is used to compute gradients, making the optimization process faster.
- **Adam Optimizer**: An advanced optimization algorithm combining the benefits of momentum and adaptive learning rates for efficient gradient descent.
- **Regularization**: Techniques to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the cost function. Examples:
  - **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: Encourages sparsity in the model by shrinking less important coefficients to zero.
  - **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**: Penalizes large coefficients to make the model more generalizable.

#### **Training and Model Behavior**
- **Masking**: A technique used to ignore certain parts of input data during model training or inference. For example, in transformers, masking ensures that certain tokens or parts of the input sequence are not considered.
- **Overfitting**: A situation where the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to unseen data due to excessive complexity.
- **Underfitting**: Occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and testing datasets.
- **Early Stopping**: A technique to prevent overfitting by halting training when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving.
- **Batch Size**: The number of samples processed before the model updates its parameters during training.

#### **Model Architectures and Learning Paradigms**
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A type of neural network designed to process data with a grid-like structure, such as images. CNNs are particularly useful for image classification, segmentation, and pattern detection.
- **Transformer**: A deep learning architecture that relies on self-attention mechanisms, widely used in natural language processing and increasingly in computer vision tasks.
- **Supervised Learning**: A machine learning paradigm where the model learns from labeled data, meaning each input has a corresponding output.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: A learning paradigm where the model generates labels or tasks from the data itself, enabling training without explicit human-labeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: A learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

#### **Visualization and Interpretability**
- **Confusion Matrix**: A table used in classification tasks to visualize the performance of a model by showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
- **Loss Curve**: A plot showing the value of the cost function during training to monitor convergence and detect overfitting.
- **Learning Curve**: A plot showing model performance (e.g., accuracy, loss) against training progress, often used to assess whether a model is underfitting or overfitting.

#### **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Grid Search**: An exhaustive search over a manually specified set of hyperparameter values to find the optimal configuration.
- **Random Search**: A more efficient method that randomly samples hyperparameter values to find good configurations.
- **Bayesian Optimization**: A probabilistic approach to hyperparameter tuning that models the relationship between hyperparameters and model performance to find optimal settings.
