## Setting Up the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:openclimatefix/open-data-pvnet.git
cd open-data-pvnet
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install the dependencies, including development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

- run basic verifications (It should display the version number in the console):

```bash
python -c "import open_data_pvnet; print(open_data_pvnet.__version__)"
```

### 4. Create a .pypirc file in your **home directory** (~/.pypirc):

```bash
nano ~/.pypirc
```
    Add the following to the file:
    [distutils]
    index-servers =
        testpypi
        pypi

    [testpypi]
    repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
    username = __token__
    password = <TEST_PYPI_TOKEN>

    [pypi]
    repository = https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
    username = __token__
    password = <PYPI_TOKEN>


### 5. Build and upload the package to TestPyPI:

```bash
rm -rf dist/ build/
python -m build
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

### 6. Verify the package on TestPyPI:

Go to https://test.pypi.org/project/open-data-pvnet/ and check that the package is there.

### 7. If the TestPyPI upload is successful, upload the package to PyPI:

```bash
python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```

### 8. Verify the package on PyPI:

Go to https://pypi.org/project/open-data-pvnet/ and check that the package is there.

### Notes

- Always bump the version number if the following files before uploading a new release:
    - `pyproject.toml`
    - `src/open_data_pvnet/__init__.py`
    - `README.md`

- Ensure all tests pass locally using pytest:
```bash
pytest
```
- Use tools like `ruff` and `black` for linting and formatting:
```bash
ruff check .
black .
```
